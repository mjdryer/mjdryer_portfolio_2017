                    <h4>Front-End Developer</h4>

                    <p>From a pretty young age, I've found myself drawn to technology. Like most 5-year-olds, I thought I was going to grow up to become a scientist, an astronaut, and a wizard. Unlike most kids, however, I'm still chasing those dreams. My end goal? Use technology to change the world.<br><br> 

                    I've worked as a software developer, an IT technician, an event planner, and yes, even a golf cart washer. I'm not afraid to put myself into a new field that's different, uncomfortable, and even a little scary in order to make a difference in someone's life. In fact, I thrive on it. With every day that passes, I'm working to make tomorrow a better day for those around me.</p>

                        <h5>HTML / CSS</h5>
                        <p>You may not think about it, but this page is actually part of my portfolio too! I designed and built this website all on my own, over the course of a few days. It was designed to look similar to a page I had built with Wix a few years ago for a personal website, but with my own code and styling. Additionally, I've created other (vastly different) pages for myself, just inc case there is ever a need.</p>

                        <h4>Registration Form</h4>
                        <h5>MailChimp / SCSS</h5>
                        <p>Often times, developers are thrown into a project late in the game, and asked to finish up a job someone else started. Here, I was asked to hook up a website built by others to a MailChimp campaign that I created through embedded registration forms. I quickly learned about the MailChimp API, how to use SCSS, and embedding forms with iframes.</p>

                        <h5>JavaScript / PHP</h5>
                        <p>One of my first projects while working at the Digital Corps last year was to create a plugin for a Ball State WP Multisite, which allowed network admins of the multisite to publish and manage videos from Vimeo and Lynda for the users of the multisite to watch. This was my first time using WP, but have since gone on to create plenty of WP sites and plugins.</p>

                        <p>Did I mention that I'm also a student? Pictured here is a relational graph for a database designed by me and two other students for a Database Design class last year. We studied entity and attribute relations, data clustering, data mining, and even touched on the newer ideas of Big Data. Sure, the project was all about Pokemon, but that didn't make it any easier!</p>

                    <h1>FAITH</h1>
                    <h4>Working for Christ</h4>
                    <p>While what I do is certainly important, it's not nearly as important
                    to me as who I am doing it for. Sure, I'm working for a company, an individual,
                    or something similar, but at the end of the day, my goal is to do everything
                    I do for the Lord.. As St. Paul writes in his first letter to the Corinthians, </p>
                    <p id="faith-quote">Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God</p>
                    <p>But faith isn't just important in the workplace, of course!
                    While at school, I've remained active in my faith by leading retreats for
                    my local Newman Center, joining the group of young men who serves daily mass each day, and leading a Men's Group who twice weekly to pray the Rosary and
                    hear talks from priests and seminarians.</p>
