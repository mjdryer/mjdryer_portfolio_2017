                <h3>Becoming My Childhood Hero</h3>
                <p>A quick elevator pitch: From a pretty young age, I've found myself drawn to technology.
                Like most 5-year-olds, I thought I was going to grow up to become a scientist, an astronaut,
                and a wizzard. Unlike most kids, however, I'm still chasing those dreams. My end goal? Use technology
                    to change the world.
                <br><br>I've worked as a software developer, an IT technician, an event planner, and yes, even a golf cart washer.
                <span>I'm not afraid to put myself into a new field that's different, uncomfortable, and even a little scary in order
                    to make a difference in someone's life.</span> In fact, I thrive on it. With every day that passes, I'm working to make tomorrow a better day for those around me. Ready to join me?</p>

                <p>Below is a very brief collection of some of the work that I've been
                a part of in the last few months, including work for class, work for my
                employer, and work for fun.</p>

                            <p>Often times, developers are thrown into a project late in the
                                game, and asked to finish up a job someone else started. Here,
                                I was asked to hook up a website built by others to a MailChimp
                                campaign that I created through embedded registration forms.
                                <span>I quickly learned about the MailChimp API, how to use SCSS,
                                    and embedding forms with iframes.</span></p>

                                of my portfolio too! I designed and built this website all
                                on my own, over the course of a few days. It was designed
                                to look similar to a page I had built with Wix a few years
                                ago for a personal website, but with my own code and styling.
                                <span>There's some hidden effects on this site too, somewhere...</span></p>

                                students for a Database Design class last year. <span>We studied
                                entity and attribute relations, data clustering, data mining,
                                and even touched on the newer ideas of Big Data.</span> Sure, the

                                last year was to create a plugin for a Ball State WP Multisite,
                                which allowed network admins of the multisite to publish and
                                manage videos from Vimeo and Lynda for the users of the multisite
                                to watch. <span>This was my first time using WP, but have since gone on
                                to create plenty of WP sites and plugins.</span></p>

                <p>It's not an 'all work and no play' kind of life that I choose to live. These pictures show a little snapshot of my friends and I in our natural habitat. Having fun! <br/> In my spare time, I love to be outdoors. From ultimate frisbee and canoeing to week long road trips to the mountains of Colorado, I find that I spend more time outside than I do inside. And if you sneak a peek at the picture on the middle-left, you'll see that I've also been taking my free time to the skies, and learning to fly! <br/> When I'm not outside, I spend my days reading Stephen King and playing board games like Catan and Risk. These keep my mind occupied and encourage constant learning and strategizing, which I find to be some of the most important parts of life.
